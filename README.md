#Airbnb


The project is to help Airbnb hosts to maximize income on Airbnb. Rental income is primarily driven by two factors: Occuputancy Rate and Listing Price. I performed the analysis on those two aspects. The end goal is to use the insights to help hosts make better decisions and increase income. 

### Project Design: 
Rental income is primarily driven by two factors: Occuputancy Rate and Listing Price. The analysis is conducted from the two aspects. Firstly, get an understanding of customers' needs. This is used to better serve customers and enhance occuputancy rate. Secondly, Predict appropraite pricing for hosts to list their apartments.This is to enhance earning potential

Step 1: Clean up datasets and perform regression on listings. Perform feature selection to drill down to features with satistical significance
Step 2: Clean up datasets and idenify apartments that have prices available in last 12 months. Add day of weeks and months as features. Perform price analysis and modeling.
Step 3: Perform topic modeling on customer reviews. Extact major topics that customers dicuss about for positive experience.  

### Tools: 
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Pickle for data storage
- SVD for dimension reduction
- KMeans for cluster analysis

### Data: 
- Dataset #1: Listings of apartmnets (name, host, apartment related information) - 10k+ listings
- Dataset #2: Listings of prices for a year - 240k+ prices
- Dataset #3: Customer Reviews - 150K+ reviews


### Algorithms:
